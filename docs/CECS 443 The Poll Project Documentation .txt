Purpose
The document “CECS 443 The Poll Project Document” serves as a comprehensive guide for the development and understanding of the software project titled "The Poll Project".
Audience
The intended audience of this document includes project stakeholders, developers, testers, and anyone involved in the project lifecycle.
Introduction
Project Overview
Due to the large size of the campus, a pressing issue at CSULB is the inability to find fun activities or locations on campus. “The Poll Project” intends to change this problem. "The Poll Project" involves the development of a rating and polling application specifically designed for CSULB students. It enables registered users with a valid CSULB ID to anonymously post and engage in reviews, ratings, and polls related to campus entities such as labs, events, food establishments, cafes, and concerts thus providing CSULB students a way to find and discuss locations and events.
Project Goals
* Improve navigating through campus.
* Provide a platform for CSULB students to anonymously post and participate in reviews and ratings for various campus entities.
* Have an informed student community of facilities.
* Provide real-time reporting capabilities.
* Develop a robust system architecture with scalable features to accommodate future enhancements and expansions.
Glossary
* CSULB: California State University, Long Beach
* Poll: A questionnaire designed to gather opinions or preferences from users on campus-related topics, typically consisting of multiple-choice questions.
* Rating: An evaluation given by users to specific entities on campus, such as labs, events, food establishments, cafes, and concerts, typically on a scale with an arbitrary number of points.
* Review: An anonymous commentary provided by users regarding their experiences with specific entities on campus, including labs, events, food establishments, cafes, and concerts.
* Campus Entity: A restaurant, building, or other operation on campus. For example, the Outpost Grill, Liberal Arts-4, or the CSULB library.
